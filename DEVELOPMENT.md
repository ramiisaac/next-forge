## ⚠️ Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

These warnings are normal for local development:

1. **Clerk Authentication**: Using placeholder keys - replace with real ones for production
2. **Stripe Webhooks**: CLI installed but not authenticated - run `stripe login` when needed
3. **Vercel Toolbar**: Not linked to Vercel project - only needed for production
4. **Tailwind Warnings**: Normal for docs app with separate Tailwind config
5. **Environment Variable Warnings**: Expected for services not configured (BetterStack, etc.)
